## Comments
- I still need to learn bootstrap to use bootstrap well. Less css and html makes coding faster. 
- Bootstrap has own css so it was difficult to work on.
- It's not responsive yet and I haven't figure it out how to create dropdown hover for navbar by bootstrap.
- I start enjoying create SVG by doing in Figma. In this case, Uniqlo logos (Japanese version and English version).
- It was my first time to imitate a website to create. I learned many thing from this project going through bootstrap.

### Question from me
- I can't tell if I'm using this Uniqlo font properly.
