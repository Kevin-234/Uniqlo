## Comments
- I still need to learn bootstrap to use bootstrap well. Less css and html makes coding faster. 
- Bootstrap has own css so it was difficult to work on.
- It's not responsible yet and I haven't figure it out how to create dropdown hover for navbar.
- I start enjoying create SVG by Figma. In this case, Uniqlo logos.
- It was my first time to mimic a website to create. I learnt many thing from this project going through bootstrap.
- I can't tell if I'm using this Uniqlo font properly.
